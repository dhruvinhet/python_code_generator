3. **Run the application:**
   The script will automatically open the application in your web browser.  If not, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `run_project.py`).

4. **Frontend Setup (if needed):** If you cloned only the backend, you'll need to separately install frontend dependencies. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the appropriate command (e.g., `npm install`, `yarn install`).

## Development

* To run the project in development mode (with hot reloading for the frontend), simply run `python run_project.py`.

* **Backend:**  The backend is assumed to be in the `backend` directory (adjust if necessary).

* **Frontend:** The frontend is assumed to be in the `frontend` directory (adjust if necessary).


## Production

For production deployment, you will need to:
1. Package your frontend application (e.g., using `npm run build`).
2. Deploy your backend (e.g., using a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI).
3. Configure a web server (like Nginx or Apache) to serve both the frontend and backend.



## Troubleshooting

* **GPU issues:** Ensure your CUDA drivers and PyTorch are correctly configured for your GPU.
* **Dependency conflicts:** Check your system's Python environment to resolve any dependency conflicts.
* **Port conflicts:** If the specified ports (3000 for frontend, 5000 for backend) are already in use, change them in `run_project.py`.
