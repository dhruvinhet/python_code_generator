## Data Structure

### Car Data (`car_data.csv`)

- `model`: Car model name
- `daily_rate`: Cost per day in USD

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501)

## Using the Application

1. **View Cars**: The main page shows all available cars with their details
2. **Make a Rental**: 
   - Select a car from the dropdown
   - Enter the number of rental days
   - Click "Request Rental" to see the cost
   - Click "Confirm Rental" to complete the transaction
3. **Check History**: Scroll down to see all past rentals

## Sample Data

The application comes pre-loaded with 15 sample cars including:
- Economy cars (Honda Civic, Nissan Altima)
- Mid-range cars (Toyota Camry, Mazda CX-5)
- Luxury cars (BMW 3 Series, Mercedes C-Class)
- Electric car (Tesla Model 3)

## Notes

- When a car is rented, its availability is automatically set to `False`
- Rental history is automatically updated with each transaction
- The system prevents renting unavailable cars
- All data is stored in CSV files for persistence

## Troubleshooting

- If you get a "Car data file not found" error, ensure `car_data.csv` exists in the same directory
- If rental history doesn't display, the `rental_history.csv` file will be created automatically on the first rental
